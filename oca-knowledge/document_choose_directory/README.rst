Choose document directories
===========================

This addon enables users to choose a directory while uploading a file. In
combination with access permissions on directories, this can be used to
restrict access on certain records' attachments or simply for a better
overview.

Configuration
=============

Create a static directory and choose the resource model you want to use this
directory on. Assign groups to whom this directory should be accessible. When
uploading a files, users can select one of the directories they have access to,
or no directory which is the default setting.

Keep in mind that if a directory has a owner, it's only visible for this user,
that's probably not what you want.
