Management Systems - Nonconformity Claim
========================================

This module was written to extend the nonconformity form so it can also represent 
NC candidates and other types of feedback, such as complaints, measurements, suggestions, etc.

The "type" field identifies if the feedback corresponds to a nonconformity, or
to other type of record, such as "best practice", "suggestion", etc.

This module purpose overlaps with "mgmtsystem_claim" module, so you should use
either one or the other.

It will fit best to your uses cases requiring:
  * a common numbering sequence for complaints and nonconformities;
  * a single point-of-entry for all management system related occurrences.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* go to Management Systems >  Nonconformities
