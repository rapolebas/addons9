==========================================
Refund Returned Pickings from Sales Orders
==========================================

This module extends the functionality of sales orders to support marking some
returned pickings as "To refund in Sale Order" and to allow you to create
invoices deducting the products that are returned and refunded.

Usage
=====

To use this module, when some customer returns some refundable products to you
before you created an invoice, you need to:

#. Go to *Sales > Sales Orders > Create*.
#. Choose a customer and add a product whose *Invoicing Policy* is *Delivered
   quantities*, and input some quantity to sell.
#. Confirm the sale.
#. Go to *Delivery > Validate > Apply > Reverse*.
#. Set *Quantity* to a lower quantity than the sold one, and enable
   *To Refund*.
#. Press *Return > Validate > Apply*.
#. Go back to the sale order.
#. Press *Create Invoice > Invoiceable lines > Create and View Invoices*.
#. The created invoice's amount will be the difference between the delivered
   and the returned quantity.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This addon is a pseudobackport of a functionality that exists natively in
  v10, plus a fix for https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/13974, so this addon
  will never have to be migrated to v10.
