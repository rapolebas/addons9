Street3 in CRM Lead Addresses
=============================

It depends on partner_address_street3 addon
(located in OCA partner-contact project) that adds
a street3 field on partner object.

This addon adds a third field to the lead addresses
and passes the street3 address value on the created partner
when the lead is converted in an opportunity.
